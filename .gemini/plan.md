### Analysis

The user wants a plan to implement the changes for Jira issue ECS-7. The issue summary is "Hello Wolrd" and the description is "Change to dark theme". This indicates that the goal is to apply a dark theme to the application.

Based on the file structure, the project is a React application using Vite and Tailwind CSS. The styling is likely handled in `src/index.css` and potentially other CSS files in `src/styles`. The main application component is `src/App.tsx`.

To implement a dark theme, I will need to:
1.  Modify the Tailwind CSS configuration to enable the dark mode feature.
2.  Update the main application component to toggle the dark mode class on the root HTML element.
3.  Add dark mode styles to the global CSS file.

### Plan

1.  **Enable Dark Mode in Tailwind Config:** Modify `tailwind.config.js` to enable dark mode using the `class` strategy. This will allow toggling dark mode by adding a `dark` class to the `<html>` element.
2.  **Update `src/App.tsx`:** Add a state variable to manage the theme (e.g., `const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light')`). Add a button or other UI element to toggle the theme. When the theme is toggled, add or remove the `dark` class from the `document.documentElement`.
3.  **Add Dark Mode Styles:** In `src/index.css` (or a similar global stylesheet), add CSS variables for colors that will change between light and dark themes. Then, use these variables throughout the application. Define the dark mode colors within a `.dark` selector.
4.  **Present for Approval:** The final step is to present this plan to the user for review and approval.
